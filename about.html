        <h1>About Hamza</h1>
        <article style="text-align: center; padding: 0px 80px">
          <p>
            I'm Hamza, a grade 10 student currently attending
            <em>Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC)</em> &
            <em>Fort Richmond Collegiate</em>. In my spare time, you can find me
            playing various sports such as squash, taekwondo, hockey, soccer and
            many more! I also enjoy biking and volunteering in the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            I excel and perform very well in academics and maintain a
            <u>98% average</u> whilst receiving many academic awards in
            STEM-related competitions. I am a focused, hard-working and
            dedicated student with strong work ethics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to being athletic and focused in academics, I regularly
            assist in the community - whether it be raising money for charities,
            babysitting, or teaching programming to aspiring kids.
          </p>
