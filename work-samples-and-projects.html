        <p>
          Over the past few years, I have worked on numerous projects both, in
          school and outside of school. The following are a few diverse projects
          that I've worked on over the last few years.

        <h1>Best Overall Group Project</h1>
        <p>
          In 2018, my friend and I had been working on a science fair project
          for about 3 months. Our science fair project was called: "Does
          temperature affect the bounce of a tennis ball?" We had conducted
          multiple experiments during different conditions to see the result and
          test our hypothesis. In the Manitoba Schools Science Symposium (MSSS)
          we had won a gold medal, Best Overall Group Project, and a special
          award from Engineers Geoscientists Manitoba. This was a very
          interesting experience for me and helped spark my interest in science
          and science fairs.

        <!-- Brief description of the project. -->
        <h1>Space Odyssey Essay</h1>
        <p>
          In Grade 9, I wrote an essay titled: "How Space Odyssey's HAL shows
          why we should not be dependent on technology." After watching the
          movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, I was supposed to write an essay
          relating to the movie. I had observed that the sentient computer, HAL,
          represents a lot of the dark truths of technology today. I had spent a
          lot of time planning and writing this essay in order to make it as
          polished it can be. I also included proper MLA formatting. I received
          full marks for my essay. This essay is a great example of my writing
          skills and the level of professionalism I include in my essays.

        <h1>Arcade Machine</h1>
        <p>
          In our Software Development class, as a final assessment project, we
          were assigned into groups and had to build a fully working arcade. We
          had to build the arcade and build an arcade game to go along with it
          as well. In our group, we had decided to make a 2D platformer game,
          with our own characters & sounds. I was responsible for coding the
          game as well as being the team lead. I used the Unity Game Engine and
          the programming language, C#, to create the game. Our game is called
          "Food Fight" and the player has to control a taco character and reach
          a diamond at the end of each level. However, there are different traps
          and enemies in the way that the player has to avoid.

        <h1>Books For You Website</h1>
        <p>
          On November 11, 2017, I launched my very own book review website
          called <em>Books For You</em>. I created the book review website using
          Wix. The original intent of creating the website was so that I could
          share what books I had been reading and help my friends and classmates
          decide what books they should read. Over time, as I read more books I
          made a short review about it and posted it on the website. Currently,
          I have decided to completely change the look of the website and add a
          schedule of when new book reviews will be published. I intend to make
          the website have book reviews of a wide range of books.<br />

      <!-- This is the fifth project. It's about a dystopian fictional newspaper called "The Daily Martian". -->
      <section>
        <!-- Brief description of the project. -->
        <h1>The Daily Martian</h1>
        <p>
          In grade 8, my friends and I had to make a video, essay, etc. with a
          dystopian theme. We had decided to make a futuristic newspaper called
          "The Daily Martian". It was meant to be a newspaper written for a
          human settlement on Mars. We decided to make a special edition of "The
          Daily Martian" covering different (made-up) news articles about an
          artificial intelligence/nuclear war. We decided to have the special
          edition be made up of five articles that would be connected to one
          another. Each one of us had to pick which article we wanted to write.
          Furthermore, I was responsible for the design of the entire newspaper
          and also added additional features (i.e. "Get to know the author",
          "Did you know?", etc.). My article is on the last page of the
          newspaper and it's where I write about the impacts the war had on
          humanity.

        <h1>Best in Grade Science Fair</h1>
        <p>
          In grade 7, I once again participated in the science fair. This time I
          decided to do an independent project. My science fair was titled "The
          Effects of Financial News on Investor Behaviour in the Stock Market".
          I had worked on my science fair project for more than 4 months! In
          this science fair project, I improved my research, presentation, and
          report-writing skills. I used proper terminology in different parts of
          my report which my judges commended. For my test subjects, I had
          various people from different age groups and experience in the stock
          market participate in my experiment. In the Acadia Junior High science
          fair, I won a gold medal and a Best in Grade award. In the Manitoba
          Schools Science Symposium (MSSS) I won a silver medal.

      <!-- This is the seventh project. It's about a spaghetti bridge made by Hamza. -->
      <section>
        <!-- Brief description. -->
        <h1>The Oily Crossway</h1>
        <p>
          In grade 7, one of our final science assignments we needed to do was
          to build a bridge out of a certain material. Every group was assigned
          a specific material to make their bridge out of. My group was assigned
          to use spaghetti to make the bridge. I was assigned as the team leader
          and was supposed to oversee the project. Our first problem was that we
          weren't sure what our bridge's design should be. I did a bit of
          research online and found a specific design that was very strong and
          rigid. Another problem we faced was that since there were different
          types of spaghetti we needed to decide what type we should pick. I
          decided that we should modify our design to use Fettuccine as the
          bottom part (road) due to its flat edges. Another major issue that we
          faced was that we needed to paint our bridge, we originally tried
          painting it with normal paint. However, it wasn't an effective
          solution, we instead opted to use spray paint.

        <h1>Silent Movie - Lemonade?</h1>
        <p>
          Recently, our class was assigned a project where we had to make a
          silent movie. In my group, I was meant to be the writer. I had to
          write and layout all the scenes for the silent movie. In the silent
          movie, a person who's very tired enters a house where there is free
          lemonade. However, as they enter the house they find themselves in an
          illusion. Furthermore, a ghost appears complicating matters, even
          more, resulting in a chase. As the person escapes the house they find
          the lemonade they were looking for! As they drink the lemonade all
          their problems end and the ghost gets defeated! This was a very fun
          and enjoyable project from which I learned a lot about the role a
          writer has during a movie.

          In grade 8, I had participated in the Acadia Junior High science fair.
          This time I was researching the topic of blockchain technology. I was
          also reading about how an increase of counterfeit medicines had caused
          a lot of people in underdeveloped areas serious illnesses and in most
          cases, death. I wanted to develop a model of using blockchain
          technology and integrate it into the pharmaceutical industry. I
          participated in the Acadia Junior High science fair and won the Best
          in Computer Science award and a gold medal.

      <!-- This is the tenth project. It's a science experiment Hamza conducted about static electricity. -->

        <h1>Static Electricity Project</h1>
        <p>
          Recently, my class was assigned an assignment where we had to make a
          video of us demonstrating static electricity. I decided to make a
          video of me demonstrating static electricity by rubbing a balloon on
          my head and creating an effect of 'bending' the water. Rubbing the
          balloon on my head generates the static charge. Then the charged
          balloon attracts the water creating the bending effect. This was a
          very interesting project as I was able to conduct an enjoyable and
          very interesting experiment.
